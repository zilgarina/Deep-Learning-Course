        "# **Creating Numbers/images with AI: A Hands-on Diffusion Model Exercise**\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "In this assignment, you'll learn how to create an AI model that can generate realistic images from scratch using a powerful technique called 'diffusion'. Think of it like teaching AI to draw by first learning how images get blurry and then learning to make them clear again.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What We'll Build**\n",
        "- A diffusion model capable of generating realistic images\n",
        "- For most students: An AI that generates handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset\n",
        "- For students with more computational resources: Options to work with more complex datasets\n",
        "- Visual demonstrations of how random noise gradually transforms into clear, recognizable images\n",
        "- By the end, your AI should create images realistic enough for another AI to recognize them\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Dataset Options**\n",
        "This lab offers flexibility based on your available computational resources:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Standard Option (Free Colab): We'll primarily use the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, which works well with limited GPU memory and completes training in a reasonable time frame. Most examples and code in this notebook are optimized for MNIST.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Advanced Option: If you have access to more powerful GPUs (either through Colab Pro/Pro+ or your own hardware), you can experiment with more complex datasets like Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, or even face generation. You'll need to adapt the model architecture, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Resource Requirements**\n",
        "- Basic MNIST: Works with free Colab GPUs (2-4GB VRAM), ~30 minutes training\n",
        "- Fashion-MNIST: Similar requirements to MNIST\n",
        "CIFAR-10: Requires more memory (8-12GB VRAM) and longer training (~2 hours)\n",
        "- Higher resolution images: Requires substantial GPU resources and several hours of training\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Before You Start**\n",
        "1. Make sure you're running this in Google Colab or another environment with GPU access\n",
        "2. Go to 'Runtime' → 'Change runtime type' and select 'GPU' as your hardware accelerator\n",
        "3. Each code cell has comments explaining what it does\n",
        "4. Don't worry if you don't understand every detail - focus on the big picture!\n",
        "5. If working with larger datasets, monitor your GPU memory usage carefully\n",
        "\n",
        "The concepts you learn with MNIST will scale to more complex datasets, so even if you're using the basic option, you'll gain valuable knowledge about generative AI that applies to more advanced applications.\n",
